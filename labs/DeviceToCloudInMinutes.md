In this lab youâ€™re going to learn how easy it is to connect any device to the cloud in a matter of minutes.

You are going to use a device simulator to send messages to **Azure IoT Hub**. All messages will be directly forwarded to **EventHubs** by adding **Routes** to IoTHub.

A **StreamAnalytics** Job will be created that will stream the output to **PowerBI** to create a realtime dashboard. Next to the PowerBI output we will route certain events (ex: high temperature) towards **Azure ServiceBus**, these events will be picked up by a **Logic App** and posted on a **Slack** channel.


## Pre-Requisites

- Visual Studio
- Azure Subscription
- PowerBI Subscription
- Access to a Slack Channel

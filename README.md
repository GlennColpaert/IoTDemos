Azure IoT Demo's, Labs and more
=================================

The explosive growth of the “Internet of Things” is changing our world and today the Internet of Things knows almost as many applications as there are types of devices connected.

This repository contains all the code & labs I created to give an overview of the latest evolutions of Internet of Things solutions on the Microsoft Azure Platform.

## Demo's

This solutions contains different projects and demo's.

#### DeviceEmulator

Basics **Console Application** that generates random Temperature and Humidty values. These values are then passed toward Azure IoT Hub.

#### RaspBerryPI.SenseHat

**Windows Universal Application** that connect to a RaspBerryPI equiped with a SenseHat. Reads all sensor values and processes them towards Azure IoT Hub. This project also includes **CloudToDevice messaging** and **Direct Methods**.

This project makes intensive use of the [RPi.Sensehat repository](https://github.com/emmellsoft/RPi.SenseHat).
